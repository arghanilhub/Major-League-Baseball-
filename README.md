<h3>SITUATION</h3>
<hr> 

As a Data Analyst Intern at **Major League Baseball (MLB)**, I’ve been granted access to decades of player records—spanning details 
from schools attended to salaries and performance metrics. My task? To uncover how player statistics have shifted over time and 
reveal key patterns across different teams in the league. <br> 

<h3>OBJECTIVES</h3> 
<hr> 
Analyzed the dataset across four key sections to uncover insights:<br> 

* **Career Stats:** What does each player's career journey look like? <br>
  
* **Player Comparisons:** How do players' attributes stack up across teams? <br>
  
* **Schools Attended:** Which schools have produced the most MLB players?	<br>
  
* **Salary Comparisons:** How much do teams invest in player salaries? <br>
<br> 

<h3>DATA STRUCTURE</h3> 
<hr> 
The dataset consists of four tables that capture various aspects of MLB players' historical data: <br>  

* **Players:** Contains unique player records, including attributes such as date of birth (DOB), debut and final game dates, and other quantifiable metrics like height, weight, and batting hand. <br> 

* **Salaries:** Records of player salaries paid by their respective teams for each year. <br> 

* **School Details:** Lists each school’s name along with its location. <br> 

* **Schools:** Tracks which schools players attended in a given year. <br>

Each table contains a different number of records. For instance, the Players table includes around 18,000 unique player records, while the Salaries table may vary in size depending on the number of salary records available. <br>
